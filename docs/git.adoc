== Version Control

In the simplest sense, version control tracks changes to a group of files.
Building off of this premise, teams can use version control to cooperatively
change a group of files and revert to a previous state if needed.

The benefits of a version control system can be more readily understood if we
consider a few examples:

.Programming Project
====
You are working on a project for your CS101 class and you need to write a
Python program that plays tic-tac-toe. It must support player-vs-computer
_and_ player-vs-player. It's due in two days. On the first day you write the
initial code and implement player-vs-player. It works great and you fall asleep
knowing tomorrow you will finish it and turn it in on time. The next morning
you update it to support player-vs-computer and _everything_ stops working.
What do you do now? 
====

If you were working with a version control system, you could easily see what
you changed and even roll-back your changes.

.Working with a Team
====
You are working working with a team of people to build a complex system that
utilizes several files in several different directories. How do you make sure
everyone has the most up-to-date version of the files? What happens if two
people work on the same file at the same time?
====

In a version control system, you could set up a centralized repository for the
files and have everyone pull from one location.footnote:[It is important to note
that although this is the dominant way git is used, it is not actually the way
git was _intended_ to be used. With git you can work in a group, merging changes
from multiple contibuters, all without a central server.] In the case of two
people working on the same thing at the same time, a version control system
could help with merging their changes by examining the lines that where changed,
finding conflicts, and suggesting resolutions.

== Installation

Depending on the OS you are using, there are a few different ways to install
git.

Windows::
* https://gitforwindows.org/[git for windows]: Installs git, git BASH, and a
GUI. The git command is put in your path and can be run from PowerShell, CMD, or
the BASH shell (which it installs).
Mac::
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/[git for Mac Installer]:
  Provides an easy installer for git on MacOS. 
* https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode]: Xcode installs a command line git
  and you may have it installed already. 
Linux::
* Basically all distributions have git available in their standard package
  manager. Chances are, if you're running Linux you have it installed already,
  so I'll take the opportunity to highlight the strangest distro I can think of:
  You can install git in http://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/[Hannah Montana
  Linux] with the command `apt-get install git`.

== Basic Git Actions

=== Creating a Repository

Any directory can be made into a git repository by running the `git init`
command. This will add the `.git` directory which stores information about the
state of the repository and configuration.

=== Cloning a Repository

If you want to make a copy of an already existing repository, typically done
when you _start_ working on a project, the `git clone` command will do that
using any supported protocol.

=== Tracking / Staging Files

You need to tell git which files you want it to track and when you want to stage
them to be committed. These both use the same command `git add`. The
first time you use `git add` it begins tracking the file and stages it for a
commit. The second time you use `git add` only stages that file for a commit.

=== Committing Changes to a Repository

Once you have made some changes to your repository and staged those files with
`git add` you can use the `git commit` command to _commit_ your changes. All
commits must have a message, and git will use a default editor depending on
your installation.
https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git[
This can be changed.] To complete the commit, add a message, save the file, and
exit the editor. If you don't want to use an editor, the `-m` option allows you
to specify a commit message on the command line.

=== Setting Up a Remote

Git repositories are often linked to a remote repository. This could be a
service, like https://github.com[GitHub], https://gitlab.com[GitLab], or
https://sr.ht[SourceHut] or more simply another server that the team has
access to. The `git remote add origin` command adds a remote URL as the default
target for actions. You can then `git push` your changes to the remote or
`git pull` to get the latest changes from the remote. The `git clone` command
automatically sets the origin.

== Example

Let's take a look at an example of two people, Jessica and Darsh, working with
the same remote repository:

----
<1> Jessica will be creating the repository, so she makes a new directory
<2> Inside the directory, she uses `git init` to initialize it
<3> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/set-content?view=powershell-7[
She adds some content so she has something to commit]
<4> The form `git add .` means _stage all files in this directory_. It is a
common invocation of `git add`.
<5> Jessica commits her work. The `-m` option allows her to add a commit
message without needing to open an editor.
<6> She adds a remote as the default. This _does_ require configuration on the
remote server, a local machine in our case, but we will talk about how that is
usually handled in the <<GitHub>> section.
<7> She pushes her changes to the remote so that Darsh can get them.

----
<1> Darsh isn't creating a new repository so he uses the `git clone` command to
clone the repository Jessica has made.
<2> By default, cloned repositories are put in their own directory based on the
repository name. You can specify a different directory by adding an argument
after the URL: `git clone ssh://git@192.168.10.1:/home/git/example.git
new-directory`
<3> Jess's content is there!
<4> Darsh appends a message of his own.
<5> He follows the standard add, commit, push work flow to sync his changes.

.Jessica's Second Session (PowerShell)
[source, console]
----
PS jess\example> Get-Content -Path 'test.txt'
Hello from git! <1>
PS jess\example> git pull origin master <2>
git@192.168.10.1's password:
From ssh://192.168.10.1/home/git/example
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

Fast-forward
 test.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
PS jess\example> Get-Content -Path 'test.txt'
Hello from git! <3>
Hello Jess!
----
<1> When Jess goes to check on Darsh's work, it isn't there! Why?
<2> Because she hasn't pulled from the remote yet.
<3> Once she does, she can see Darsh's work.

This scenario begs the question, "What would happen if Jess didn't pull Darsh's
work and kept working on her local, unsynced copy?" Assuming they were both
working on the same file, when Jess goes to push there would be a
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts[merge
conflict.] Git is very good at resolving conflicts and team members tend to be
working on different parts of the codebase, making the resolution simpler.

== Questions

[qanda]
What are the advantages of using version control?::
    Version control allows you to keep track of _all_ changes to a set of
    files. If something goes wrong and you need to get to a previous state,
    you can. Likewise, if you want to see how you did something in the past
    you can look through a history of changes. Finally, version control makes
    it easier for teams to work together by helping resolve conflicts when
    two authors change the same file.
What does it mean that files are _staged_ for a _commit_?::
    These are files that have been marked to be included in the next commit.
    Typically they have changes in them and they are part of a larger change
    to the entire project. They aren't committed yet, but once you perform
    the commit action and enter a commit message they will be.
What are the two things that the `git add` command can do?::
    `git add` can tell git to begin tracking a file _and_ it can tell git to
    _stage_ a file for the next commit.
How do you create a new repository in a directory?::
    The `git init` command turn the working directory into a git repository.
    Note that you need to be in the directory that you want to make into a
    repository.
What is a _remote_ and what does the `git push` command do?::
    A remote is a non-local server (typically external) that stores your git
    repository. The `git push` command _pushes_ the current version of your
    git repository to the remote server. It is usually used after you have
    completed a commit so that the other members in your team have access to
    the new version of the repository.
