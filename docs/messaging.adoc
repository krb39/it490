= Messaging

== Purpose

Messaging allows multiple components to use a common medium to exchange
information. The goal is to create a system that is more extensible,
resilient, and scalable. By using a messaging framework you can establish the
interfaces between components and worry less about idiosyncrasies of
communication.

One of the easiest ways to understand the advantages of a messaging layer is to
view it as a bus carrying information between components. While you may only
have a few components now, what happens if you want to expand?

[plantuml, messaging-bus, svg]
....
@startuml
nwdiag {
    network Messaging {
        iOS_Client
        Android_Client
        MacOS_Client
        Linux_Client
        Windows_Client
        Web_Interface
        Point_of_Sale
        Back_End
    }
}
@enduml
....

It would be arduous to have to write unique code for eight components to
facilitate communication. By using a messaging framework, this is taken care of.

If the interfaces are well thought out, messaging frameworks can also take
advantage of caching. Examine the following scenario:

[plantuml, messaging-cache, svg, width=80%]
....
@startuml
"Front End" -> Messaging: GET Picture USER 42
Messaging -> "Back End": GET Picture USER 42
"Back End" -> Database: "SELECT Picture FROM Users WHERE id=42;"
Database -> "Back End": 1KB of Data
"Back End" -> Messaging: 1KB of Data
Messaging -> "Front End": 1KB of Data
"Front End" -> Messaging: GET Picture USER 42
Messaging -> "Front End": 1KB of Data (cached)
@enduml
....

The second time a `GET Picture USER 42` request is received, *Messaging* already
knows the answer and can respond with a cached copy. A well-designed messaging
framework will allow you to adjust cache parameters to achieve significant
performance gains without serving stale data. Cache invalidation is a
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html[famously difficult] problem,
but at least with a messaging framework you are not trying to solve it by
yourself.

Messaging frameworks allow components to be built and profiled independent of
other components. Want to know how many requests a client is generating so you
can better build a back end to support it? Check the statistics of the messaging
queues you are using. Want to be able to completely swap out a component without
any of the other components noticing? Use a messaging framework.

That's not to say that all projects take advantage of a messaging layer. Often
it's viewed as "just another thing to get in the way" or another possible
bottleneck. Many projects attempt to shoe horn the messaging framework in later
on, a difficult feat. We will avoid that here by mandating that _a messaging
framework must be used from the start._

== Frameworks

The two most popular messaging frameworks are https://www.rabbitmq.com/[
RabbitMQ] and https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka]. We will briefly discuss each
platform, but it is important to note that we will be using RabbitMQ in this
text. Milestones and deliverables in the project will require things specific
to RabbitMQ. All systems must function within constraints and one of the
constraints on the system we are going to design is that it _must_ use
RabbitMQ.

RabbitMQ is built with https://www.erlang.org/[Erlang] and
https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/users_guide.html[OTP], a system meant
for solving the large-scale, distributed problems that are prevalent in the
telecom industry. It is hard to think of a platform more suited to the task of
messaging. RabbitMQ supports traditional messaging paradigms and uses a
standard messaging protocol: https://www.amqp.org/[AMQP]. This allows for
application libraries in _many_ different languages including Python, Java,
Ruby, PHP, C#, JavaScript, Go, Elixir, Objective-C, Swift, and Spring AMQP.

Kafka was built by the Apache project in Java. It uses the publish and subscribe
model, the most common messaging model. It includes a broker by default meaning
it often requires less set up for standard messaging scenarios. While it may not
offer as much choice in _exactly_ how messages are handled it does support large
data streams incredibly well.

== RabbitMQ and Docker

The https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq[documentation for the official RabbitMQ
Docker image] is quite good and covers many of the topics we will touch on in
here in greater detail. Please refer to it for further explanation.

The stock RabbitMQ image uses different versions to specify if the management
interface should be enabled. You will probably want to use the web-based
management interface at first to see what is going on. To do so you will need to
run a management version and you will also need to expose port `15672` on your
container to your local machine.

RabbitMQ can also use a few different environment variables to store secrets:

RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER:: By default, RabbitMQ will use the user name `guest`.
Technically we should only be able access our RabbitMQ container internally,
but it is still a good practice to change this to something specific to our
project.
RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS:: By default, RabbitMQ will use the password `guest`. It
would be a good idea to change this as well.
RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE:: Erlang nodes use this for authentication. As far as we
are concerned this will only become important when we run multiple instances of
a RabbitMQ container and they need to communicate with each other.

Let's start up a container running the management interface and take a look:

[source, shell]

----
<1> Notice how we specify a new user and password, forward a port from our
local machine, and request the management image.
<2> Since we don't have the image, it will be pulled from Docker Hub
automatically.
<3> RabbitMQ tells you what version of Erlang it is using. Clustering requires
nodes to run similar versions, so this can be an important bit of information.
<4> If you don't specify an Erlang cookie, one will be chose randomly. This is
it, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64[base64] encoded.
<5> There are _a lot_ of startup messages and it can take some time for
RabbitMQ to start. I've cut them out of the output here.
<6> Once you see this, you're node is up and running.

Now, we should be able to visit http://localhost:15672 and see the management
interface running. Using our user name / password of example / example, we can
sign in. Take a moment to look around the interface. Queues are created
automatically by applications so you won't need to configure anything, but once
you have components up and using RabbitMQ you can look here to see the queues
they've created and to make sure that everything is working. When you are all
done type Ctrl+C to detach from the `docker run command` and use `docker stop`
to stop the container:

[source, shell]

PS > docker ps <1>

== Questions

[qanda]
Why would a project choose to use a messaging framework?::
  A messaging framework allows you to build components and not have to worry about the minutiae of how they will interface with other components. Messaging libraries are available for most languages and are easy to integrate. Using a messaging framework also allows you to perform auditing to better analyze your application.
What is caching and what are its benefits?::
  Caching stores a known result for a particular input. This allows you to quickly return a result without having to do the back end work that may typically be required. It can provide greater responsiveness for common client message flows.
What is AMQP?::
  AMQP is a standard and open messaging protocol used by many messaging frameworks and client libraries.
How can you specify that you want to enable the management interface in the official RabbitMQ Docker image?::
  You need to use the management image as specified in the version name: `rabbitmq:3.8` vs `rabbitmq:3.8-management`.
Why should you change the RabbitMQ default password and how do you change it?::
  Even though your internal Docker network will not be exposed to the outside world, it is still a good practice to set a RabbitMQ password that is different from the default. This can be done by changing the `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS` environment variable on the *Messaging* container.
How would you start up a RabbitMQ instance in Docker Compose, with the same options we used in the example?::
[source, yaml]
----
  version: '3'
  services:
    messaging:
      image: 'rabbitmq:3-management'
      environment:
        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: example
        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: example
      ports:
        - 15672:15672
