= Project

This text is meant to accompany the creation of a group project. The project is
designed to be completed by a four person group over a 15 week semester. If you
are using this text as part of a course, all parts of this section are subject
to change / augmentation by your instructor. If you are using this text as an
independent, self-study tool you should still be able to complete all of the
milestones and create the deliverables although it may take you longer. What
follows is the typical assignment structure for developing the project:

== Project Proposal

The project proposal and the comments on it function as a record of dialog
between the instructor and the group. You can think of the proposal as a
contract showing what is required to achieve a good grade on the project. The
instructor may specify additional deliverables depending on what your group has
chosen to work on, or they may walk-back your proposal if they believe it is
too difficult.

=== Developing a Proposal

A data-first approach often helps in coming up with a project. Think of a data
source that could be used to create a marketable software as a service (SaaS)
product. For the purposes of this project, the data source needs to be freely
available. Use the following questions to guide your proposal:

* What data will you use?
* What service will you offer with this data?
* Why would people be willing to pay money for your service?
* Who would be willing to pay money for your service?

Here are a couple of examples that you can _not_ use:

.Project Proposal
====
My group will design a web app that allows people in New Jersey to create
itineraries for upcoming events based on the current weather forecast. We will
use data from https://openweathermaps.org[OpenWeatherMaps.org] as well
https://www.nj.com[NJ.com] to plan separate events based on how filled people
want their schedule and what the weather is predicted to be. Our target
demographic is busy professionals who are comfortable using technology. Since
they already use services like Google Calendar for keeping track of their
events, why not try using a service that will suggest upcoming events? The time
they save planning would easily be worth the cost of the service.

.Project Proposal
====
A wealth of 18th century recipes can be found at
https://savoringthepast.net/category/18th-century-cooking/[Savoring the Past].
My group will create a web application that lets you put in your ingredients,
your cooking technique (open fire, dutch oven, brink oven, etc.) and see what
recipes you could cook. This app would be useful to historical enthusiasts who
may not have time to look through all of the recipes, but still wish to use a
an old time recipe. Currently it is very difficult to search through all the
information and this can be intimidating for a new chef.

== Milestones

Milestones exist to encourage groups to keep pace with the project. This is not
the kind of project that can be completed in the last week of class. All
milestones should be entered in GitHub and linked with Issues assigned to
specific members of the group. Individual contributions of group members will be
assessed through GitHub activity so be sure you are actively participating.

=== One

* The group has four members.
* Each member of the group has read the <<Git>>, <<GitHub>>, <<YAML>>, and
  <<Docker>> chapters.
* Each member of the group has Docker up and running on their machine.
* Each member of the group has a GitHub login that utilizes their school email.
* The group has designed and submitted a <<Project Proposal>>.
* The group has created a GitHub repository with all of the members as
  collaborators.

=== Two

* Each member of the group has read the <<Messaging>>, <<Database>>,
  <<Front End>>, and <<Back End>> chapters.
* The group has created a `docker-compose.yml` file in the group repository that
  brings up a messaging service, database service, front end service, and back
  end service.
* *Front End* has a "Hello World" page available on a port accessible from the
  local host.
* *Back End* can read from and write to a queue on *Messaging*.
* The completion of this milestone is documented through the use of Issues in
  the group GitHub repository.

=== Three

* *Back End* can read and write from *Database*.
* *Front End* has a register new user page and a login page. They do not have to
  be functional, but the HTML for the page is being served.
* *Database* has a `user` table in a database on a persistent volume and the
  database can be accessed by *Back End*.
* Documentation is developed that describes how to use the RabbitMQ management
  interface to check to see if queues are being created. The documentation
  is in the form of a `README` file in any GitHub supported format within the
  messaging directory.
* The completion of this milestone is documented through the use of Issues in
  the group GitHub repository.

=== Four

* Each member of the group has read the <<Replication>> and <<Kubernetes>>
  chapters.
* Each member of the group has minikube up and running on their machine.
* *Database* has moved from a single instance to a replicated, high
  availability, load balancing cluster. For now, the instances can be statically
  configured inside a `docker-compose.yml` file.
* The completion of this milestone is documented through the use of Issues in
  the group GitHub repository.

=== Five

* Each member of the group has read the <<Database in Kubernetes>> and
  <<Messaging in Kubernetes>> chapters.
* *Database* has been migrated to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. All 
  of the Kubernetes objects for *Database* are in one file named db-k8s.yml in
  the group GitHub repository.
* *Messaging* has been migrated to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. All
  of the Kubernetes objects are in one file named messaging-k8s.yml in the group
  GitHub repository.
* The completion of this milestone is documented through the use of Issues in
  the group GitHub repository.

=== Six

* Each member of the group has read the <<Front End in Kubernetes>> and
  <<Back End in Kubernetes>> chapters.
* *Front End* has been migrated to Kubernetes using the minikube environment.
  All of the Kubernetes objects are in one file in the named front-end-k8s.yml
  in the group GitHub repository.
* *Back End* has been migrated to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. All
  of the Kubernetes objects are in one file named back-end-k8s.yml in the group
  GitHub repository.
* The completion of this milestone is documented through the use of Issues in
  the group GitHub repository.

== Deliverables

Deliverables are larger assessments designed to show a running system. Given
the containerized nature of the project, it should be easy to bring up the
deliverables on any system to test them. Groups are encouraged to test their
system on different machines to make sure that everything will go well when it
is time to assess their project. Groups are also encouraged and _expected_ to
keep the deliverables in mind over the course of the entire project.

=== Midterm

* *Front End* (Python, PHP, or Node) interacts with the user via HTTP and
  communicates with *Messaging* via a messaging library.
* *Messaging* (RabbitMQ) brokers the exchange of information between *Front End*
  and *Back End*.
* *Database* (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, or MySQL) is used by *Back End* for the
  storage of persistent information. All database files are stored in a Docker
  volume.
* *Back End* gathers information from data sources, stores information on
  *Database*, and interacts with *Messaging*.
* These four services are working with each other to provide a registration and
  authentication system for users.
* The project is fully testable on any machine running Docker by cloning the
  group git repository and running `docker-compose up` in the root of the
  project.

=== Final

* *Front End*, *Database*, *Messaging*, and *Back End* are all running in pods
  on a minikube Kubernetes Cluster. Each has three replicas.
* *Front End*, *Database*, *Messaging*, and *Back End* are all able to scale
  horizontally and recover from the failure of pods.
* The project is fully testable on any machine running minikube by cloning the
  group git repository, building the custom images locally (with an environment
  configured for the Docker daemon running _within_ minikube), and running
  `kubectl apply -f .` in the root of the project.
