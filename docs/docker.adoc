== Purpose

Traditionally, virtualization has made use of a virtual machine (VM) to
provide an isolated environment in which an operating system (OS) and
applications can run. This allows the application to have a completely custom
environment and ultimately makes it easier to deploy.

.Maintaining a Legacy Application
====
Prithi is in charge of maintaining a payroll system that uses Perl, a web
server, and a CGI module. This system requires specific, older versions of each
of those components to function. Unfortunately all of the web servers that her
company uses are upgrading to newer versions and removing Perl and the CGI
module from their environment.

In order to continue running the system, Prithi asks the team that maintains the
servers if they will run a VM for her. Prithi can install the version of Linux
that she needs on the VM and use the packages the payroll system requires. If
appropriately isolated, any problems on the VM would be limited to just the
payroll system. The web servers can be upgraded _and_ Prithi can maintain the
payroll system thanks to virtualization with VMs.
====

If you expand this example a bit, and have a team that runs a datacenter,
provides VMs to customers, and charges for the amount of resources the VM uses,
you have the beginnings of infrastructure as a service (IaaS). As servers run
multiple VMs, you end up with a system that looks like this:

Every VM having to run its own OS and emulate a unique machine creates a lot of
overhead. Containers allow for similar isolation as VMs, but at a reduced
resource cost since ass opposed to VMs which emulate a physical machine,
containers use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups[control groups],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces[namespaces], and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot[chroot] to allow _containers_ to share the
same operating system, but still be isolated. A server running containers has
significantly less overhead and looks like this:

There are many different container runtime environments including:
https://linuxcontainers.org/[LXC], https://containerd.io/[containerd],
https://coreos.com/rkt[rkt], and https://www.docker.com/[Docker] (on containerd
at this point). We will be using Docker due to its popularity and its ability be
easily installed on various operating systems. By using Docker, we will be able
to create a system that can be tested and used on any other machine that runs
Docker.

== Installation

There are several options for installing Docker on your device, depending on the
operating system and hardware that you use:

Windows::
* https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding[Docker Desktop] should run fine
  on any Windows system that supports
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem
  for Linux 2 (WSL2)].
Mac::
* https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding>[Docker Desktop] should run fine
  on most Macs. We will be running it from the terminal so do not be alarmed if
  you install it and do not see an application running.
* If for some reason your computer is not supported you can try the MacOS version
  of https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/[Docker Toolbox], but Docker Desktop is
  preferred.
Linux::
* Docker can easily be installed natively on Linux and packages for Docker exist
  for all major distributions.

== Concepts

An image is the complete file system of a Linux instance. You can think of it
like the hard drive of a server that someone has already set up. Images can be
tagged using the format `name:version`. One of the reasons Docker is so popular
is because there are many pre-built images available. If you try to use an image
that does not exist on the local machine, Docker will automatically attempt to
`pull` that image from the https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] container
registry.

Docker can `run` containers by taking images, copying the file system, and
running commands on that file system within an isolated environment. This is
called running a container. You can run several containers from the same image
since the file system is cloned.

.Images, Containers, and the Registry
[plantuml, images-containers-registry, svg, width=60%]
....
@startuml

rectangle dh as "Container Registry" {
    rectangle "Image 1" as dhi1
    rectangle "Image 2" as dhi2
}
rectangle lm as "Local Machine" {
    rectangle "Images" {
        rectangle "Image 1" as i1
        rectangle "Image 2" as i2
        rectangle "Image 3 (locally created)" as i3
    }
    rectangle "Containers" {
        rectangle "Container 1" as c1
        rectangle "Container 2" as c2
        rectangle "Container 3" as c3
        rectangle "Container 4" as c4
    }
    i1 ---> c1
    i1 ---> c2
    i2 ---> c3
    i3 ---> c4
}

dhi1 ---> i1
dhi2 ---> i2

@enduml
....

In the above image, you can see that two images were pulled from the container
registry: Image 1 and Image 2. Once images are pulled, they are locally cached.
Image 3 was built locally and is available on the local machine, but is not
available from the registry. From those images, four containers have been run.
Container 1 and Container 2 are both using the same image, but keep in mind
they have their own _copy_ of the file system.

== Commands

Docker commands are run via the `docker` command line interface (CLI) in a
terminal.  Here is a _brief_ listing of some of the most useful commands:

images::
Lists images that are locally available.
ps::
Lists the _currently running_ containers.
pull::
Downloads an image from the container registry (Docker Hub by default).
run::
Creates a container from an image and starts that container. If a command is
specified that command is run, otherwise the default command for the image is
run.
exec::
Executes a command on an _already running_ container.
stop::
Stops a running container.
rm::
Removes a container.
image rm::
Removes an image.
build::
Builds the Dockerfile in the directory specified into an image.

WARNING: It is easy to forget that the build command takes an option as that
option is sometimes the current directory. Don't forget the period at the
end of a `docker build .` command.

NOTE: Both the `run` and `exec` commands need to be passed the `-it` option if
you want to run something interactively. This is often the case if you run a
command like `bash` where you will by typing in shell commands.

As you use Docker, it will download / create a lot of resources and it can be
helpful to clean those resources up periodically. Here are some commands to do
just that:

system prune::
Removes resources that aren't in use by any containers. This includes inactive
containers: stopped containers that may be used again.
image prune --all::
Removes all images that aren't _currently_ being used. After you have been
running Docker for a while, this can free up gigabytes (GB) of space.

== Examples

For the following examples, it is assumed that you have Docker installed and
that you are in a terminal with an environment that can run the `docker`
command. This may be PowerShell if you installed Docker Desktop on Windows,
Terminal if you are in MacOS, or even the Docker Quickstart terminal if you
installed Docker Toolbox on Windows.

=== Running a Web Server

Let's take a look at just how easy it is to run a web server in a Linux
container with Docker:

[source, console]
----
PS > docker run -d -p 8080:80 httpd:2.4.43 <1>
Unable to find image 'httpd:2.4.43' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for httpd:2.4.43

fa13023485993c9ec47c805d0ce06b69b305ddf61657fbb6ec58674abb5a057b <3>
----
<1> Here we are telling Docker we want to `run` a container , `-d` in the
background (daemon mode), `-p 8080:80` with port 8080 on our local machine
forwarded to port 80 on the container, and the image is version `2.4.43` of
`httpd`. You can read more about this image https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd[
here].
<2> Because we don't have the image locally, it is pulled from the Docker Hub
container registry.
<3> Each running container is given a unique hash.

Now let's see what containers we have running with the `docker ps` command: 

[source, console]
----
PS > docker ps <1>
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND              CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
fa1302348599        httpd:2.4.43        "httpd-foreground"   5 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   eager_heyrovsky <2>
----
<1> `docker ps` shows all _running_ containers, to see _all_ containers,
including stopped containers, we could have used `docker ps -a`.
<2> This displays the container id (enough of the hash to identify it for
commands), the image that the container is copied from, when it was started,
what its status is, which ports are being forwarded, and a friendly name for
the container (automatically generated if you don't specify one) that you can
use in place of the container id in commands.

If you've been following along with these commands, you should be able to open
a web browser, go to http://localhost:8080, and see a page stating, "It works!"

Now let's clean up:

[source, console]
----
PS > docker stop fa1302348599 <1>
fa1302348599

PS > docker ps <2>
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS
PS > docker ps -a <3>
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS
fa1302348599        httpd:2.4.43        "httpd-foreground"  18 minutes ago      Exited (0) 5 seconds ago

PS > docker rm fa1302348599 <4>
fa1302348599

PS > docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS
----
<1> We know the id from the previous `docker ps` command, by running
`docker stop` we can stop the container.
<2> Now we won't see it in the plain `docker ps` command.
<3> It is still there, but stopped. We can see it with the `docker ps -a`
command.
<4> `docker rm` will remove the stopped container.

In most situations, `docker rm` isn't really necessary as stopped containers
do not actively consume resources other than local storage. Try browsing to
http://localhost:8080 again to confirm that the container is not running. You
should be unable to connect.

=== Building a Custom Image

Sometimes the stock images are not enough to do what you want. In this example
we will be building an image for a web server that still uses `httpd:2.4.43` as
its base, but adds an extra file to change the default page. To do this, we
need to create a directory with a `Dockerfile` and our new `index.html` page.
We'll do this in the `{sourcedir}` directory:

.{sourcedir}/index.html
[source, html]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/index.html[]
----

.{sourcedir}/Dockerfile
[source, docker]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/Dockerfile[]
----

A Dockerfile is a list of basic instructions for building an image. Instructions
are typically capitalized and in this case our Dockerfile is using two of them:
`FROM` and `COPY`. `FROM` tells Docker that you want to build an image on top of
another image. In this case we want to build our image on top of the
`httpd:2.4.43` image. We also use the `COPY` instruction to copy a local file
into the image we are building. In this case we copy our `index.html` into the
directory that the https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache web server] serves files
from.

NOTE: Details about what directories an image uses can often be found in the
image's documentation on Docker Hub.

To build our Dockerfile into an image, we are going to use the `build` command:

[source, console]
----
PS docker-demo> docker build -t docker-demo:v1 . <1>
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
Step 1/2 : FROM httpd:2.4.43 <2>
 ---> b2c2ab6dcf2e
Step 2/2 : COPY index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

d to build context will have '-rwxr-xr-x' permissions. It is recommended to double check and reset permissions for sensitive fil
es and directories. <3>

PS docker-demo> docker images <4>
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

----
<1> Here we specify that we want to `build` an image and we want to tag it as
`docker-demo:v1`. This command takes one argument, the directory which contains
the Dockerfile. In our case we pass it `.` to signify the current directory.
<2> You can see each instruction and the results as they are performed.
<3> Windows does not support the same file permissions as Linux so you may see
this warning if you are building on Windows.
<4> Finally we look at the images currently available. We should see that the
one we built is available.

Now let's run our custom image in a container with the `docker run` command:

[source, console]
----
PS docker-demo> docker run -p 8080:80 docker-demo:v1 <1>
AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

----
<1> Notice that we didn't pass the `-d` option to Docker run, meaning we are
running in the foreground. This is useful if we want to run something quickly
as the log messages are printed directly in your terminal.

If you open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:8080 you should see
the message "Hello from a container running a custom image!" When you are done,
you can type Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop running the container, use
`docker ps` to get its ID, and then use `docker stop` to stop it.

=== Using Docker Compose

Having to specify command line arguments for the `docker` command can get
tedious, especially as your environment becomes more complex. Docker Compose is
a tool bundled with Docker that can be used to store the configuration for a
multi-container setup in a single `docker-compose.yml` file. The best way to
learn about it is to see it in action, so let's start by looking at an example:

.{sourcedir}/docker-compose.yml
[source, yml]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/docker-compose.yml[]
----

This file defines a Docker Compose service named `web` that builds an image
from the directory that `docker-compose.yml` is in. A container is run with the
image and local port 8080 is forwarded to port 80 in the container.

Here is a brief listing of some of the most useful docker-compose commands:

up::
Brings up all services in `docker-compose.yml`
down::
Brings down all services in `docker-compose.yml` 
stop::
Stops all services or a service specified
exec::
Runs a command on _running_ service
logs::
Prints the logs for a service

Now that we know a few commands, let's bring up the `web` service:

[source, console]
----
PS docker-demo> docker-compose up <1>

----
<1> Remember this command brings up _all_ the services in the
`docker-compose.yml` file in the _current directory_.
<2> Docker Compose also creates a network for your services to run in. This
provides isolation for your services and helps with service discovery.
<3> This often trips up people the first time they use Docker Compose. If you
make changes to a Dockerfile you will have to rebuild the image, or specify
--build to `docker-compose up`, otherwise you won't see your changes.
<4> Docker Compose runs in the foreground by default and displays the aggregate
log information from all of the services running. Log messages are prefixed by
the service name. This can be _very_ useful for debugging.

We can test that things are working by going to http://localhost:8080. When we
are all done we can close things down with by typing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

== Questions

[qanda]
What is the difference between a VM and a container?::
    A VM emulates an entire machine including the operating system kernel while a container runs _within_ the current operating system kernel. This makes containers _less_ resource intensive than VMs.
What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?::
    A Docker image is a filesystem snapshot, but a Docker container is an actual up and running instance of a container. When you run the `docker ps` command it will show you what _containers_ are _running_. When you run the `docker images` command it will show you what _images_ and _available_.
How would you run a shell on an already running container?::
    `docker run -it <container-id> bash`
What does the `-d` option do when passed to the `docker run` command? When may you want to use it? When may you _not_ want to use it?::
    It runs the container in the background. You may want to use it if you have a long running container answering requests, such as a database container. You may _not_ want to use it if you are debugging something and you want to quickly see the container output as the container is running. 
What does Docker Compose do and how it is different from the `docker` command?::
    Docker Compose allows you to use a YAML to start up multiple containers with various options. This lets you build a multi-container system easily. The `docker` command is used to build/run individual containers.
