= Database in Kubernetes
:sourcedir: example-final

image::database.png[align=center, width=15%]

== Introduction

In this example we implement a primary / standby replication setup for
PostgreSQL. Two *Services* will be provided: one for read/write requests and
another exclusively for read requests. We will try to use Kubernetes to handle
the initialization and monitoring functions that had to be done by hand in
<<Replication, previously>>.

Rather than passing command line options to the `kubectl` command, we will be
defining what we create in a YAML file: `{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml`. kubectl can
load object definitions from YAML files with the `apply` command.

Now let's look at the Kubernetes objects we are defining:

== PersistentVolumeClaims

A *PersistentVolumeClaim* lets the cluster know that you are expecting certain
storage resources. In this case, we are looking for a place to store our
primary database files. This claim will be fulfilled by a
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[*StorageClass*]
that is built into minikube. As far as we are concerned, we just have to tell
it what we want and it will make it happen.footnote:[
https://platform9.com/blog/tutorial-dynamic-provisioning-of-persistent-storage-in-kubernetes-with-minikube[
The fascinating details of how this works are revealed in this blog post.]].

.{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml (excerpted)
[source, YAML]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml[tags=pv-claims]
----

This claim will be used by our _one_ `db-rw` pod, so we don't have to worry
about shared access. The supported accessModes are:

* *ReadWriteOnce* - can be mounted read / write by only one pod
* *ReadOnlyMany* – can be mounted read-only by many pods
* *ReadWriteMany* – can be mounted as read-write by many pods

== Services

A *Service* exposes an application on a group of pods. In our case we will be
providing two *Services*: a `db-rw` *Service* which connects to our primary
PostgreSQL instance and a `db-r` *Service* which connects to our standby
PostgreSQL instances. Unlike Docker Compose, even on our internal network we
have to explicitly state which ports we make available.

.{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml (excerpted)
[source, YAML]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml[tag=services]
----

The `selector` field above defines how a *Service* knows which pods to utilize.
In our case all pods with the app label `db-r` are used by the `db-r` *Service*
and a similar rule is applied to the `db-rw` *Service*. Both services accept
incoming connections on port 5432 and route those connections to 5432. In the
case where there are multiple pods in a *Service* a load balancing scheme is
used by default.

From a service discovery perspective, Kubernetes *Services* make things easier.
If you want to connect to a read-only database instance all you have to do is
use the hostname `db-r`. Similarly, if you want to connect to a read-write
database, use the hostname `db-rw`. The DNS resolution, load-balancing proxy,
and routing are set up automatically.

== Deployments

A *Deployment* tells Kubernetes how to create and monitor pods. The bulk of our
work will be done in the `db-r` and `db-rw` *Deployments*. Fortunately we have
already covered the logic of what needs to happen <<Replication,previously>>, so
let's jump right in and take a look at the *Deployment* for our primary
PostgreSQL instance:

.{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml (excerpted)
[source, YAML]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml[tags=db-rw-deployment]
----

Ths *Deployment* tells Kubernetes to maintain one `replica` of the pod defined
in the `template` section. The `containers` section is a list of one container
that uses the `postgres` image from Docker Hub and overrides the ENTRYPOINT of
that Dockerfile (this is `command` in Kubernetespeak). Our script is taken
almost line-for-line from our <<Replication,previous example>>. Lastly, this
deployment makes use of our *PersistentVolumeClaim* defined previously and
mounts it in `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

Let's take a look at the *Deployment* for our standby PostgreSQL instances:

.{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml (excerpted)
[source, YAML]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/db-k8s.yml[tags=db-r-deployment]
----

This *Deployment* stands up two replicas. Each replica clones the primary
database (using the hostname `db-rw` provided by our `db-rw` *Service*) and then
acts as a hot standby. A *PersistentVolumeClaim* is _not_ used, meaning if push
came to shove, we may not be able to easily recover the database from one of
these containers.

Notice that neither *Deployment* has to search for the primary or monitor the
other instances. Kubernetes handles this for us. In fact, the standbys don't
even have to wait for the primary to be up. If they can't clone the database,
they will fail and Kubernetes will restart them until they work.

Much of the hard work of our <<Replication, earlier example>> is now handled for
us by a _proper_ orchestration framework.

== Running the Example

Let's take a look at the example in action:

[source, shell]
----
PS example-final> kubectl apply -f .\db-k8s.yml
persistentvolumeclaim/db-primary-pv-claim created
service/db-rw created
service/db-r created
deployment.apps/db-rw created
deployment.apps/db-r created
----

The `kubectl apply -f` command can be used to bring up all of the objects
defined in a file. It should also be noted that it can work with an entire
directory of files, allowing for separation of logical segments, unlike a
`docker-compose.yml` file.

[source, shell]
----
PS example-final> kubectl get pod
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-r-54d9bc6496-cjhn8    1/1     Running   1          2m31s
db-r-54d9bc6496-pg8b2    1/1     Running   0          2m31s
db-rw-6fd7767ddd-g6kvj   1/1     Running   0          2m31s
----

`kubectl get pod` show you all of the pods that are currently running. All of
the pods in our deployment are now up. They are given hash codes for the second
part of their name to keep them unique. You may notice that
`db-r-54d9bc6496-cjhn8` had to be restarted once. It probably came up before
`db-rw-6fd7767ddd-g6kvj` was ready to have its database cloned.

Using the command `kubectl logs` we can get the logs for a pod. Let's take a
look at our primary PostgreSQL instance:

[source, shell]
----
PS example-final> kubectl logs db-rw-6fd7767ddd-g6kvj
+ '[' -s /var/lib/postgresql/PG_VERSION ']'
+ rm -rf '/var/lib/postgresql/data/*'
+ chown postgres /var/lib/postgresql/data
+ su -c 'initdb --username=postgres --pwfile=<(echo "changeme")' postgres
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

Just as <<Replication, before>>, the primary node initialized a database, set
up a replication user, and started `postgres`.

Let's take a look at one of the standby nodes:

----

This standby backed up the primary database and started streaming logs from the
primary.

The `kubectl exec` command lets you execute a command on a running pod. Lets
use this to run psql on one of the standbys, connect to the primary, create
a table, and then check to see if it shows up on the standbys:

[source, shell]
----
PS example-final> kubectl exec -it db-r-54d9bc6496-pg8b2 -- bash
root@db-r-54d9bc6496-pg8b2:/# psql -h db-rw -U postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-2.pgdg100+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \dt
Did not find any relations.
postgres=# CREATE TABLE test(test_column INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# \dt
        List of relations
 Schema | Name | Type  |  Owner
--------+------+-------+----------
 public | test | table | postgres
(1 row)

postgres=# \q
root@db-r-54d9bc6496-pg8b2:/# psql -h db-r -U postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-2.pgdg100+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \dt
        List of relations
 Schema | Name | Type  |  Owner
--------+------+-------+----------
 public | test | table | postgres
(1 row)

postgres=# \q
----

Sure enough, anything we create on the primary (which we access by resolving
the name `db-rw` shows up on the standby. Now lets try performing a write
operation on a standby:

[source, shell]
----
root@db-r-54d9bc6496-pg8b2:/# psql -h db-r -U postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-2.pgdg100+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# CREATE TABLE test2(test_column INTEGER);
ERROR:  cannot execute CREATE TABLE in a read-only transaction
----

It fails, as it should. Lets take a look at how *Services* glue all of this
together with the `kubectl get service` command:

[source, shell]
----
PS example-final> kubectl get service
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
db-r         ClusterIP   10.106.33.23    <none>        5432/TCP   41m
db-rw        ClusterIP   10.99.113.228   <none>        5432/TCP   41m
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    35h
----

`db-r` and `db-rw` are *Services*, so if a pod tries to resolve on of those
names, they will get the CLUSTER-IP (10.106.33.23 and 10.99.113.228
respectively). That ClusterIP is a proxy that will forward their request to
a pod that can handle it. This allows for load-balancing and high availability.

On the subject of HA, the last thing we have to check is that pods will be
automatically restarted. Let's do something bad to one of our pods with the
`kubectl exec` command:

[source, shell]
----
PS example-final> kubectl exec -it db-rw-6fd7767ddd-g6kvj -- bash
root@db-rw-6fd7767ddd-g6kvj:/# killall5 -9
command terminated with exit code 137
PS C:\Users\rxt1077\it490\example-final> kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-r-54d9bc6496-cjhn8    1/1     Running   1          48m
db-r-54d9bc6496-pg8b2    1/1     Running   0          48m
db-rw-6fd7767ddd-g6kvj   1/1     Running   1          48m
----

`killall5 -9` will send a kill signal to all processes on the pod, causing it
to shut down. Kubernetes brought it back up again as evidenced by RESTARTS
being equal to one. While the primary is restarting you will lose write
access, but the standbys will continue to provide read access. Once it is back
up (a matter of seconds), everything should be functioning as normal.

== Conclusion

Using Kubernetes we were able to quickly build a HA PostgreSQL cluster. This is
just the tip of the iceberg for what Kubernetes supports and as you learn more
about it you should be able to revisit and improve this implementation.
