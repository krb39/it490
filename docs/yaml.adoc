= YAML

== Introduction

In the long-standing tradition of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym#Early_computer-related_examples[
informal, recursive acronyms], YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language. It
is designed to be a plain text way to represent complex objects. It is easier to
read than JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), but not as complex as Extensible
Markup Language (XML). YAML uses indentation to specify scope, like Python, and
therefore _spacing matters_.

The vast majority of what we will be creating is written in YAML so it pays to
give it at least a cursory treatment. It's even become a bit of an inside joke
that modern system architects are simply https://yaml.engineering/[YAML
engineers].

== Parts of a YAML Stream

NOTE: This section is parts of a YAML _stream_, not a YAML _document_ because
technically a single file could have multiple _YAML documents_.

Let's look at some sample streams to get a clearer picture of how YAML is used:

.Sample Docker Compose YAML
[source, yaml]
----
# source: https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ <1>
--- # <2>
version: '3' <3>
services: <4>
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
    - "5000:5000" <5>
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
----
<1> Anything following a `#` in YAML is considered a comment. Don't be afraid to
use them!
<2> YAML documents start with `---` and optionally end with `...`. This allows
multiple documents to included in a stream.
<3> `keyword: value` signals a mapping. This mapping maps the keyword `version`
to the string `'3'`.
<4> Mappings can be nested. This mapping maps the keyword `services` to
mappings with keywords `web` and `redis`.
<5> Sequences can be shown as a block of lines starting with `-`. In this case
`ports` is mapping to a sequence with one item, the string `"5000:5000"`.

NOTE: YAML strings can use single, `'`, or double, `"`, quotes. Double quotes
support escape sequences: `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, etc.

.Sample Kubernetes YAML
[source, yaml]
----
# source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2016-02-18T18:52:05Z <1>
  name: game-config
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "516"
  uid: b4952dc3-d670-11e5-8cd0-68f728db1985
data:
  game.properties: | <2>
    enemies=aliens
    lives=3
    enemies.cheat=true
    enemies.cheat.level=noGoodRotten
    secret.code.passphrase=UUDDLRLRBABAS
    secret.code.allowed=true
    secret.code.lives=30
  ui.properties: |
    color.good=purple
    color.bad=yellow
    allow.textmode=true
    how.nice.to.look=fairlyNice
----
<1> YAML supports https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO8601] date elements.
<2> The `|` indicates block scalar style. The keyword `game.properties` is
mapped to a string where the newlines are preserved but the leading spaces are
removed. The string, with newlines shown as '\n', is
'enemies=aliens\nlives=3\nenemies.cheat=true\n...'. This is a common way of
defining files or scripts within YAML.

TIP: Learn to use `|` and `|-` for multiline strings. `|-` will do the same
thing as `|` (as explained above), but will not add the newlines (everything
will be on one line).

== Editors

Given YAML's strict whitespace requirements, you will need to use a text editor
that supports configuring spacing and expanding tabs into spaces. At a minimum,
you should be able to do the following with your text editor:

* Translate tab keystrokes into spaces. This is sometimes referred to as
  _expanding tabs_. YAML files that mix tabs and spaces will not work.
* Adjust tab spacing. Typically you will see YAML files with two spaces of
  indentation for their blocks. This allows you to have many nested blocks
  without the lines becoming too wide.
* Increase/Decrease the indentation level of several lines at once. As you
  make changes, you may have to change the indentation level of a block being
  able to do this quickly, without having to visit every line will save you
  time.
* Cut/Copy/Paste - You should be able to copy things between your web browser
  and the file your are editing. If you can copy things between multiple
  tabs/buffers in your text editor, even better.
* Convert between DOS/UNIX line endings. Most of the tools you will be working
  with come from the UNIX world, where a line ends with '\n'. Some older DOS
  utilities still end lines with '\r\n'. You need to be able to save documents
  with UNIX line endings in your text editor.

There are many editors that meet these requirements. Choosing an editor is a
matter of personal taste and the subject of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war[unending flame wars]. With this in
mind the following list is not meant to be exhaustive and I'm sure the comments
may be subject of some debate. Popular editor choices:

* *link:https://www.vim.org/download.php[vim]/link:https://neovim.io/[neovim]/
link:http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/[vi]* - Some form of vi is almost always
installed on any *NIX/BSD system. Knowing how to use it can be a lifesaver when
remotely logged in to a machine. You can also find versions for Windows. Since
most of your work will be in a terminal, having an editor that runs directly
inside a terminal can be an advantage. That being said,
https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200[
the learning curve is steep]. If you are interested in learning vi, you may
want to start with either vimtutor (packaged with vim) or `:Tutor` inside
neovim.

* *https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]* - vscode is more akin to
a modern IDE. It is rapidly gaining more adoption and is certainly worth
checking out if that is the type of experience you are looking for.

* *https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/[Notepad{plus}{plus}]* -
Notepad{plus}{plus} is a popular Windows GUI text editor. It starts quickly, and
many things work right out of the box. If you want something like notepad, but a
little more versatile (the next iteration you could say) then this is for you.

* *https://macromates.com/[TextMate]* - TextMate is a popular MacOS GUI text
editor. It is simple to get started, but offers the advanced features you may
need as you progress.

== Questions
[qanda]
How does YAML signify different blocks?::
    Blocks are signified through indentation in YAML. This is similar to how
    Python delineates blocks.
Are nested structures possible in YAML? Give an example.::
    Yes.
+
[source, yaml]
----
level-1:
    level-1A:
    level-1B:
    level-1C:
level-2:
    level-2A:
    level-2B:
    level-2C:
----
What are the two components of a YAML mapping? Give an example to illustrate your point.::
    A key (or a keyword) and a value.
+
[source, yaml]
----
key: value
----
How would you comment out a line in a YAML file?::
    The `#` character at the beginning of a line comments out the whole line.
What does the expandtab or "replace by spaces" option do in a text editor and why is it important to use when working with YAML?::
    This option inserts a series of spaces every time the tab key is pressed. This is important because YAML uses indentation to define blocks and the characters used to indent need to be consistent. With this option you can use the tab key and not have to worry about whether you are inserting a tab or a space.
